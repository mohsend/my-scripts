# Script to connect to remote VPS over FTP and leech content
# I use it to download videos I leeched on VPS to be downloaded over night

# Set values to these variables:
localdir='The local directory for downloads'
vpsaddress='IPorURL/Dir'
vpsuser='Your username on the remote machine'
vpspass='Password for the username'

cd $localdir
todaydate=$(date +%F)
mkdir "$todaydate"
cd "$todaydate"

# the * tells wget to download everything on that directory
wget -c -r ftp://$vpsuser:$vpspass@$vpsaddress*
